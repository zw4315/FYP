# FYP-Image Completion Using MASK_RCNN and GLCIC
## Introduction
This repository includes the code for my final year project, using Mask-RCNN [Jiaming He et. al. 2018] and GLCIC [ Iizuka et. al. 2017] to remove unwanted object from image with automatic mask proposal. 

**Part of the code is borrowed from otenim's implementation of GICIC and matterport's implementation of Mask-RCNN, great aprreciation to these works.**
